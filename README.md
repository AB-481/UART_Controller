# UART_Controller
Configurable UART controller in Verilog with an FSM-based transmitter &amp; 16× oversampled receiver for reliable serial communication. Implemented TX &amp; RX FIFOs to buffer data and handle back-to-back transfers. Added parity generation and checking with error injection for validation. Verified functionality using loopback and self-checking testbenches.
